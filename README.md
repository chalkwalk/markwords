## Introduction
I recently made a tool to generate a random album. I thought it would be interesting if I could also generate fictitious be believable words to use with it. Overall I found the words created a little too random but I thought it was interesting enough to share. The code is quite short and the logic simple so it should be easy to comprehend.
